# STUDY COIN BY ERC20

This Solidity smart contract defines an ERC-20 token called "STUDY COIN" (symbol: STN) using the OpenZeppelin library. The contract is designed to manage student information and their associated tokens.

## Description

For this project, you will write a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat or Remix. Once deployed, you should be able to interact with it for your walk-through video. From your chosen tool, the contract owner should be able to mint tokens to a provided address and any user should be able to burn and transfer tokens.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

This code we are running on the online Solidity IDE that is https://remix.ethereum.org/ here we'll perform the code. as we are on the remix website just by clicking on the start coding we'll able to do coding in Solidity.

```

```

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the ("Compile "the name of the file" ") for ex. comple first.sol button. Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Challenge.sol" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button. then u can see a the below of the option ' Deployed/Unpinned Contracts ' expand it and balances mint burn etc and now u can see our code is ready to run .
